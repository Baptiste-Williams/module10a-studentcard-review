# Module 10A – StudentCard Code Review

## Description
This is a React assignment where I had to review a component called StudentCard. I went through the code and added comments explaining how it works — mostly around props, state, and the button that shows or hides the bio.

## What I Learned
- Props are used to pass in student info like name, major, bio, and image
- State lets you change what's shown on the screen, like hiding or showing the bio
- useState lets you set up and change state
- Writing comments can help other people understand what the code is doing

(Added a screenshot showing the StudentCard in the browser and the commented code in my editor)
