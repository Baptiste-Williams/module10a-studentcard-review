# StudentCard Component Review – Module 10A

This project was completed for the Santa Monica College Module 10A assignment, which involved reviewing and enhancing a React component called `StudentCard`.

The app displays a student’s photo, name, major, year, and a toggleable bio using props and useState for interactivity.

## Features Implemented

- Functional React component using JSX
- Dynamic content passed through props (name, major, year, bio, image)
- useState hook to toggle visibility of the bio
- Inline styling for layout and visual clarity
- Button toggles with dynamic label text ("Show Bio" / "Hide Bio")
- Debugging to fix missing imports and visibility issues

## Assignment Goal

Review and update the StudentCard code, identify bugs, explain functionality, and style the component for clarity and responsiveness.
